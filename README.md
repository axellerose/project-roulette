# Roulette of Colors

## Description:

My first project on Ironhack Fullstack course is a roulette that has colors instead of numbers.
Player has to enter amount to bet and choose 1 of 4 colored buttons to spin the roulette.
The game is infinite, but player becomes a winner if the score is over 5000


## Rules of the game

- A roulette is divivded into 36 sections of 4 colors: 
    - 14 red (payout 1 to 2) 
    - 14 black (payout 1 to 2)
    - 7 blue (payout 1 to 5)
    - 1 gold (payout 1 to 100)
- User has $1000 to play
- User selects a section and enter the amount of $
- User can press on a button with corresponding color to spin
- Game ends if a balance goes 0
- Game won if a score is over $5000
- During the game a music is played and sound effects are enabled

## MVP 

- Enter the bet amount and press on of 4 buttons to play 
- Have a roulette wheel not spinning
- Show result
- Show score
- Show a message for win/loose
